## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2017-01-03
### Added
- Import FaceTime data from macOS
- Import call, Messages, Notes, and voicemail data from iOS
- Import `.ichat` macOS Messages archives (created if ‘Save history when conversations are closed’ is enabled in Messages preferences)
- Document FaceTime and iOS support in `README`

### Changed
- Adjust `import_file` script to support custom filenames for imported files

### Fixed
- Use `HISTORY_DATA_PATH` in Photos importer
- Only run Photos importer if Photos is running (fixes a crash)
- AppleScript wrapper now looks for `*.scpt` instead of `*.sh` (copy-and-paste error)
- Adjust Bundler to install gems to `vendor/bundle`, to avoid permissions issues if the user running the script isn't an administrator
- macOS Messages importer was copying data to `data/messages/Archive/archive` and `data/messages/Attachments/attachments`; the capitalized directory has been removed
